This article will go over the key points of development of each individual stage of a Star’s life, going from being born as a Nebula and dying as either a White Dwarf, Neutron Star or a Black Hole.
After a Star has reached the third stage of its life, the next stage is determined by its mass, smaller Stars, like the Sun, go down the route of becoming a red giant, whereas Supermassive
Stars follow the route of a red super giant. A well-known example of a Red Super Giant is a Star called Betelgeuse, it’s one of the three stars that make up the Orion Belt and can be seen
with the naked eye <a href="#Reference1">(Swinburne University of Technology (no date))</a>.

Stars live very long lives relative to how long humans live, however the difference between the life span of Stars can be astronomical. Giant Stars have a lower life span to small Stars since they use up
their hydrogen fuel quicker, extremely large Stars that have approximately 10-15 solar masses will live only for a few million years <a href="#Reference2">(Ka Chun Yu (no date))</a>. This is very different to the age
a smaller Celestial Body of the same type can live till, for example, Stars with less than 0.4 solar masses burn so slowly that they might live for 100 billion years, longer than the current
age of the Universe. <a href="#Reference3">(Temming, MT. (July 15th, 2014))</a>.
                
The Life Cycle of a Star can be different depending on the mass of the Star in question, Heavenly Bodies that have a solar mass smaller than 10M ☉ have different stages in their lives than those with a solar
mass above 10M ☉.  All stars have the same three starting stages in their lives, these are a Nebula, Protostar and a Main Sequence Star. Nebulae are giant clouds of dust and gas founds across
space, where new stars begin to form. The dust and gas, mostly hydrogen and helium, gets pulled together due to gravity and as more piles up, the gravity gets stronger pulling more inwards making
the centre of the Nebula much denser. Eventually the clump of dust and gas gets so big that it collapses from its own gravity causing the material at the centre of the cloud to heat-up and this hot
core becomes the beginning of a Star <a href="#Reference4">(Nasa Science (no date))</a>. This is known as a Protostar, a Protostar is remarkably like a Main Sequence Star, however its core is not yet hot enough for fusion
to take place. The surrounding gas and dust around the Protostar take the shape of a disk which spins around the core. As the Protostar absorbs more dust and gas and continues to rotate, it heats
up, once the core temperature has exceeded ten million Kelvin, the Protostar becomes a Main Sequence Star. <a href="#Reference5">(Las Cumbres Observatory (no date))</a>. Main sequence Stars fuse hydrogen atoms into helium
atoms within its core, they make up around 90% of the Universes Stellar Population and range in colour, mass and luminosity. <a href="#Reference6">(Nasa Science (no date))</a>. The only Star in our Solar System, the Sun, is
an example of a Main Sequence Star, it is a relatively small Star since some can go up to over a thousand times larger in size. The Main Sequence stage of a Star is the longest stage of its life,
Stars can be in this form for tens of billions of years.

As mentioned previously, a Star can go down one of two routes in its life depending on its mass. The first path is only for Stars with a Solar Mass less than 10M ☉, at the end of its longest stage, the
Star will become a Red Giant. This is the beginning of the end for a Star, once the Heavenly Body has run out of the hydrogen fuel necessary for nuclear fusion, it has begun the process of
its dying. At this stage, the equilibrium between the Stars gravity and the outward pressure from the ongoing thermonuclear fusion taking place in its core is lost and the core begins to collapse.
As the core collapses, the shell of plasma surrounding the core becomes hot enough to fuse hydrogen, this causes the Star to expand dramatically and the surface expands up to several hundreds of times
beyond its former size as well as losing it, white/yellow colour and turning red. <a href="#Reference7">(ESA/Hubble (no date))</a>. Parts of the shell start to drift off into space, creating a Planetary Nebula around the Red Giant.
Eventually, the Red Giant will completely drain all its fuel and shed all the gas it can, this leaves a dense core which is approximately 100 times smaller than the Red Giant was. This core is
known as a White Dwarf, the atoms with in it no longer fuse therefore the Star releases no energy, however because it’s still hot it will continue to shine until it cools. <a href="#Reference8">(NASA Science (no date))</a>.
Once a White Dwarf has fully cooled and no longer emits light it will theoretically become a Black Dwarf, however the Universe has not been around long enough for a Black Dwarf to exist yet.

The route that larger Stars with a solar mass of over 10M ☉ has a larger effect on the galaxy it resides in, some have Universal effects. After the Main Sequence Star stage, the massive Star would become a Red Super Giant.
The basis of a Red Super Giant is like that of a Red Giant, however when hydrogen can no longer fuse into helium, it fuses heavier elements instead, causing it to expand exponentially in size. Due to their massive
size, they burn fuel much faster than smaller Stars <a href="#Reference9">(Scope the Galaxy (no date))</a>. A Super Red Giant has the outward pressure of nuclear fuel burning inside the Stars core, but also gravity acting as
an inward force, keeping it in equilibrium. However, once the fuel runs out, gravity wins and the Celestial Body completely collapses in under 15 seconds, causing a Supernova. The outer part of the shell
explodes, sending all sorts of elements up to Iron scattering across the Universe, leaving behind an extremely dense core and a nebula surrounding it. <a href="#Reference10">(NASA Space Place (no date))</a>. After the explosion,
depending on the size of the Star, it can either become a Neutron Star or a Black Hole. Smaller Red Super Giants end up as Neutron Stars which is an extremely dense collapse core, whereas the larger
Heavenly Bodies become Black Holes. Black Holes have a gravitational pull so large that not even light can escape it, the centre of a Black Hole, a Singularity, has such a large Gravitational Pull
that it can even bend Space-Time.
